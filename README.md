# Uthanks

## Description
_Uthanks_ is a social network for volunteers. It helps people to find each other in different situations.  
Nowadays, almost every person has a mobile phone with a stable Internet connection. It makes communication between people much easier. Old and slow methods of finding volunteers for events are in the past. With our website, organizations just need to write an announcement and wait for replies from _Uthanks_ users.  
People with an opportunity and desire to help somebody can sign up and find a task where their qualities may be useful.
